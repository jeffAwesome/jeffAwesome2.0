One of the most frequent questions I get asked is **"why aren't my ads converting customers?"**.
I'm getting clicks, people are coming to my website but no one is buying.   Sound Familiar?

There are several reasons why your website and ads might not be converting, but the one I ask most clients first is...


Is your website answering the questions your potential customers are asking?
===========================================

To answer this question you first need to know what type of customer your business wants.

Who is your ideal customer ?
-------------------------------

This could be job seekers looking for a way to get that
interview at their dream job, clients looking for more customers, existing businesses who want repeat customers.

Once you understand this, the next question is to ask yourself is...

What do these customers want from my business?
-------------------------

A good example is a company I'm working with currently that handles data algorithms/projections for Daily Fantasy sports.

The algorithms and projections actually produce amazing data that you can sort through. This data actually helps people win. Despite this fact, the first launch of this product wasn't yielding many sales.

They brought me in to help dive deeper into what the ideal customer wanted and put this in place. It may seem obvious to the reader, but customers wanted **TO WIN MORE**.
They didn't care about how complex the algorithms were. They didn't care about the expertise of the staff (math and software wizards). They wanted to WIN MORE. PERIOD.

And its contributing to new sales that already double what they've made the first time around. And the new product isn't even launched!!!

The key takeaways are:

**1. Understand who your ideal customer is.**

**2. Talk to those ideal customers and answer the questions they need answered. (i.e. win more, get more clients, sale more to existing customers, get their dream job... etc).**

Good luck and Be Awesome
