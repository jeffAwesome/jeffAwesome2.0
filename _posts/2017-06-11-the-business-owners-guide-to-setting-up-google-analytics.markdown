Why do i need google analytics?
================================

If you’re a business owner and have a website its absolutely crucial to have analytics on your website.
**Are you losing out on potential new customers because they’re leaving your site immediately after visiting?**

Google analytics can give you buckets of crucial information including:

* How many people are visiting my website?
* How long are customers staying on my website?
* Where are my visitors coming from?
* Do I need a mobile version of my website?
* How many visitors are turning into customers or leads?
* Where are my customers coming from?
* and so much more.

What do i need to setup a google analytics account?
====================================================

You’ll need a gmail [gmail account ](https://myaccount.google.com/ "Google Account") If you have an account that you use for gmail,
Google Drive or Youtube you are already good to go. If not you will need to create a new email. Its free.

Once you have a gmail account its time to setup an [analytics account](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none).

It’s always best to use an account that you intend to use forever. A business email something like yourbusiness@gmail.com
is always the best bet when deciding on an email address using gmail.

Now its time to sign up for a google analytics account.
========================================================

Now that you have a primary google account .Its time to sign up for google analytics account.
Go into [the analytics page](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none)  and click the “Sign into Google Analytics” button.

What does it all mean?
=======================

Google Analytics is setup as a hierarchy.  You have up to 50 Google Analytics accounts under one google account.
Each Google Analytic account can have up to 50 properties.  You can have 25 views under each property.

**Account Name:**<br />
For now were going to assume that you have a single website with a single view.
The  “Account Name” will be the name of your website.  For instance “John Doe - Tax services”

**Website Name:**<br />
The website name will be your website address. For instance “johndoetaxes.com" .

**Website Url:** <br />
This will also be your website URL.  For instance “johndoetaxes.com"

**Industry Category:** <br />
Make sure to choose the closest category to your business. This is important because Google Analytics can actually
give you information about how you’re comparing against other businesses.

**Reporting Time Zone: ** <br />
Make sure to choose your businesses time zone.

Beneath all of this will be information about sharing your data.

Once you agree to those terms you’ll know see the analytics code page.

This code must be installed on every single website on your website.
This also depends on your setup. If your business is using a wordpress website your theme will sometimes have a
section to apply the code.


Other content management systems may have other sections where you’ll be instructed to put the code.

Once you’ve installed the code you’ll be able to get analytics data to better help your business. But of course that’s
just the beginning. Over the next few Analytics post we’ll cover how to view your data and how to setup goals.


So that’s it for today. Good luck and **Be Awesome**.
