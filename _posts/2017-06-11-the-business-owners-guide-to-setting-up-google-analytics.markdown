* How long are customers staying on my website?
* Where are my visitors coming from?
* Do I need a mobile version of my website?
* How many visitors are turning into customers or leads?
* Where are my customers coming from?
* and so much more.

====================================================

You’ll need a gmail [gmail account ](https://myaccount.google.com/ "Google Account") If you have an account that you use for gmail,
Google Drive or Youtube you are already good to go. If not you will need to create a new email. Its free.

is always the best bet when deciding on an email address using gmail.
