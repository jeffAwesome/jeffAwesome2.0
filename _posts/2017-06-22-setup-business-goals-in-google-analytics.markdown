What in the world is a conversion Goal?
===============================
**Did a new user sign up for your site or service?**  Did you get a new sale? A new contact form submission?
**These are all Goals.**

So lets get started!
=======================

Now that you've [setup Google Analytics and installed the tracking code on your website](http://jeffawesome.com/2017/06/11/the-business-owners-guide-to-setting-up-google-analytics.html)
and then [setup at least one filter to clean up your data](http://jeffawesome.com/2017/06/13/the-business-owners-guide-to-using-google-analytics.html)
its time to add some website goals.

Setting up a goal is very straightforward but as usual its not the only piece of the story.

Usually, but not always Goals are setup in conjunction with business funnels.
A funnel is a set of pages or actions a user goes through before reaching a website goal.

This post isn't covering a funnel but we will cover the topic in the future.
Knowing that A Goal isn't the only piece of the puzzle can and will help you have a better perspective.
Having that better perspective will help you grow your business.

Give me a real world example?
===========================

A good example is also the real life example of a lead form submission.

If you're a small business a lead form submission or contact form submission can be the lifeblood of your business.

So how do we add a goal in Google Analytics?

**Log into Google Analytics, drill down into one of your profiles, and click Admin in the top navigation.**

**Click on the Goals Link. Make sure to select that this will be a "custom goal"**

**Enter the Goal Name... for example "Contact Form Submission" and click "Continue".**

**Enter a Goal Destination... for example "/thank-you/"**

<p><em>This  is the page the user gets to after they've submitted a lead submission form.</em></p>

**Its a great idea to enter a Goal Value even for leads that aren't giving you monetization.
This lets Google Analytics calculate metrics like Page Value and Per Visit Goal Value.**

Good luck and **Be Awesome**.
