<p>I&#8217;ve made a dramatic change in my career over the past few months. I went from completely front end development to a focus on the full stack.
Throughout my career I have always dabbled a bit in the backend changing a few lines of codes in php and then uploading them to the server via ssh or ftp, but
this is a whole new ball game. Each day I experiment and learn something new. Its 100% frustrating but get this <strong> I love it </strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working as a web developer professionally since 2008, I was 19 then, and i&#8217;m 24 now. One thing I experienced that first year and a half of my
career was this extreme learning growth spurt. I remember being completely lost but eventually I would figure it out. It wasn&#8217;t always easy,
I had to develop with ie 6 compatability in mind, but at the end of the day I would always have a sense of accomplishment. I don&#8217;t want anyone to
think I stumbled upon this field with no knowledge I had a fundamental understanding of html and css and layouts back then before jumping in,
but it wasn&#8217;t until I jumped into developing site after site that I really started to exercise this knowledge and put it to the test.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I&#8217;ve been working as a full stack developer and I feel I&#8217;m back at the beginning of the learning cycle, but I think as developers
maybe that&#8217;s the most appropriate place for us to be. I speak from experience when I say its extermely easy to get stuck in this idea of a label. Were
a front end developer, or a designer, or a programmer. It takes a large amount of work and dedication to learning something new and its extremely
frustrating at first, and maybe always.. isn&#8217;t our job about solving problems&#8230; some we&#8217;ve never had to solve before, but eventually things get easier
and you start to grasp ideas you thought you were never going to grasp. Its a wonderful feeling to finally understand, and use , an idea that you&#8217;ve
been trying to grasp for a while.</p>

<p>I know this idea of always learning isn&#8217;t new at all, but its something I truly believe in. We don&#8217;t have to be the best or the smartest but if we
always strive to learn and improve I really think we&#8217;ll always have a job&#8230; an increasingly complex job at that. I think about a quote I heard first from a pretty
cool guy <a target="_blank" href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagen</a> &#8220;If its uncomfortable, you&#8217;re growing.&#8221;. I can&#8217;t tell you how often I think about that quote,
especially when learning what at first feels awkward like learning vim, using the terminal for everything, or learning ruby and then rails within a month
period&#8230; but its extremely true. Each day things feel less awkward, but its only because I&#8217;m learning and its the normal progression. I can&#8217;t wait
to get a bit more awkward just when I think I&#8217;ve learned it all :).</p>
