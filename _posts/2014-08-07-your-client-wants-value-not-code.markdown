<p>Your client doesn't care about code. That's right, you can use the latest stack,
                        refactor until your hearts content, write clean code all day... but at the end of the
                        day your client doesn't care. They want value... not code.</p>

                    <p>I can't stress value enough. If you're wondering why you aren't getting more clients I would
                        absolutely bet it has something to do with you talking about the technology over vision.
                        I firmly believe there are two types of "freelancers". There are the freelancers and the consultants. The consultants want to understand the vision, the goals. Yes they're Senior level
                        programmers but they realize its not just about the technology. Its about listening. That's right listening. </p>


                    <p>Think back to your last potential client meeting.. what did they talk about? Do you remember?
                        If you don't there is a good chance you aren't listening. I remember when I first started consulting. I would talk about what technologies I would use to solve a small problem they mentioned. I would end up not getting the client. And its hilariously obvious now... but it took me quite some time to actually realize it was because I wasn't listening.


                    <p>I want to say right now that I still firmly believe in writing clean code. I believe that
                        as professionals its our job to bring those things to the project... but unless our clients
                        specifically ask for it... we need to relay back to them... the core problem and the solution.
                    </p>


                    <p>A good analogy for this is like a surgeon, the majority of people don't care how
                        the surgeon does the procedure as long as they "fix" their loved one. The Surgeon has spent
                        decades training and learning the best techniques but at the end of the day its their job
                        to help. That's the value.
                    </p>


                    <p>One other topic here that I can talk about for hours is bringing that value to reality. We need to care about the project. If you don't care you can't possibly believe you're good enough to bring value over the course of the project timeline. As consultants its not just about the coding phase... its easy to forget that.
                    </p>


                    <p>As Consultants its our job to solve the clients core problem in a clean and elegant way but its also our job to communicate the true value to them. Our True Value is our trade but also our ability to translate their <strong>NEEDS</strong> into an actual reality.</p>


<p>Enjoy and Be Awesome</p>
